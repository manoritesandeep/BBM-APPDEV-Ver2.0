# HorizontalProductCard Migration Note

## Date: October 10, 2025

## What Changed

The `HorizontalProductCard` component has been **moved** from:
- ❌ **Old Location**: `/components/Products/HorizontalProductCard.js`
- ✅ **New Location**: `/components/UI/HorizontalProductCard.js`

## Why the Move?

The component was moved to the `UI` folder because:
1. **Better Organization** - It's a UI component used across multiple screens, not just product-specific
2. **Logical Grouping** - It belongs with other reusable UI components like `Button`, `CompactSizeSelector`, etc.
3. **Easier Discovery** - Developers looking for UI components will find it in the UI folder
4. **Consistency** - Follows the same pattern as other card-like components in the UI folder

## Bug Fix Applied

Also fixed a critical bug where text was being rendered outside of `<Text>` components:
- **Issue**: `highlightSearchTerms` function returned plain text when no search query
- **Fix**: Changed to `renderProductName` which always wraps text in `<Text>` components
- **Result**: ✅ No more "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warnings

## Import Changes Required

### Update Your Imports

**Before:**
```javascript
import HorizontalProductCard from '../components/Products/HorizontalProductCard';
```

**After:**
```javascript
import HorizontalProductCard from '../components/UI/HorizontalProductCard';
```

## Files Already Updated

The following files have already been updated with the new import path:
- ✅ `/screens/CategoryScreen.js`
- ✅ `/components/HomeComponents/CategoryModal.js`
- ✅ `/screens/SearchResultsScreen.js`
- ✅ `/components/Products/index.js` (now exports from UI folder)

## Documentation Updated

All documentation has been updated to reflect the new location:
- ✅ `/docs/componentsDocs/HorizontalProductCard.md`
- ✅ `/docs/componentsDocs/CategoryUX-Improvement-Summary.md`
- ✅ `/docs/componentsDocs/CategoryUX-QuickReference.md`

## Backward Compatibility

The `Products/index.js` file has been updated to re-export from the new location:
```javascript
export { default as HorizontalProductCard } from '../UI/HorizontalProductCard';
```

This means you can still import from Products folder if needed:
```javascript
import { HorizontalProductCard } from '../components/Products';
```

However, **direct imports from the new UI location are recommended**:
```javascript
import HorizontalProductCard from '../components/UI/HorizontalProductCard';
```

## Action Required

If you have any custom code that imports `HorizontalProductCard`, update the import path:

1. Search for: `from '../components/Products/HorizontalProductCard'`
2. Replace with: `from '../components/UI/HorizontalProductCard'`
3. Or: `from '../../components/UI/HorizontalProductCard'` (depending on your file location)

## Benefits

- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Easier to find and maintain
- ✅ Consistent with other UI components
- ✅ Fixed text rendering bug
- ✅ No breaking changes (backward compatible through index.js)
