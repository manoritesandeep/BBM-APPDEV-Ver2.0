# Category Search and Filter Feature

## Overview

This feature adds in-category search and advanced filtering capabilities to the CategoryScreen, allowing customers to quickly find and filter products within a specific category.

## Implementation Date

October 10, 2025

## Features Added

### 1. Category Search Bar

- **Location**: Header of CategoryScreen
- **Component**: `CategorySearchBar.js`
- **Functionality**:
  - Searches products only within the current category
  - Voice search support
  - Debounced input for performance
  - Highlights search results
  - Does not navigate away from category (unlike global search)

### 2. Advanced Filter System

- **Components Used**:

  - `CompactFilterBar` - Quick filter access
  - `FilterPanel` - Full filter modal
  - `FilterContext` - State management

- **Filter Options Available**:
  - Brand
  - Price Range
  - Rating (4+ stars, 3+ stars, etc.)
  - Color
  - Size
  - Material
  - Availability (In Stock, Out of Stock)
  - Discount (20% off, etc.)
  - Sub-category

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- **Combined Search and Filter**: Users can search AND filter simultaneously
  - Example: Search "white" + Filter by "4+ stars" + "Price under ₹1000"
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Product count updates dynamically
  - Shows active filter count
  - Displays search query in results
- **Performance**:
  - Virtualized lists for smooth scrolling
  - Efficient re-renders with useMemo and useCallback
  - Grouped products by name (combines same products with different sizes)

## File Changes

### New Files Created

1. **`components/SearchComponents/CategorySearchBar.js`**
   - Specialized search bar for category-level search
   - Reuses `EnhancedSearchBar` component
   - Custom placeholder based on category name

### Modified Files

1. **`screens/CategoryScreen.js`**

   - Added search state management
   - Integrated FilterContextProvider
   - Added CompactFilterBar and FilterPanel
   - Implemented combined search + filter logic
   - Enhanced empty states (no results, no matches, etc.)
   - Updated header to include CategorySearchBar

2. **`components/SearchComponents/index.js`**
   - Added export for CategorySearchBar

## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
CategoryScreen (wrapper with FilterContextProvider)
└── CategoryScreenContent
    ├── CategorySearchBar (in header via navigation.setOptions)
    ├── CompactFilterBar (quick filter access)
    ├── FlatList (product display)
    │   └── HorizontalProductCard (each product)
    ├── FilterPanel (modal)
    └── ProductModal
```

### Data Flow

1. **Products Input**: `productGroups` from navigation params
2. **Flattened for Filtering**: Products are flattened and passed to FilterContextProvider
3. **Filter Applied**: FilterContext provides `filteredProducts`
4. **Search Applied**: Search query filters the already-filtered products
5. **Grouping**: Products are grouped by name for display
6. **Render**: DisplayProducts shown in FlatList

### State Management

- **Local State** (CategoryScreen):

  - `categorySearchQuery` - Current search query
  - `filterPanelVisible` - Filter panel visibility
  - `selectedProduct` - Product modal state
  - `refreshing` - Pull-to-refresh state

- **Context State** (FilterContext):
  - `filteredProducts` - Products after filters applied
  - `appliedFiltersCount` - Number of active filters
  - `activeFilters` - Current filter selections

## How It Works

### Search Flow

1. User types in CategorySearchBar (in header)
2. `handleCategorySearchChange` updates `categorySearchQuery`
3. `displayProducts` useMemo recomputes:
   - Takes `filteredProducts` from FilterContext
   - Applies search using `searchProducts` utility
   - Groups results by product name
4. FlatList re-renders with new displayProducts

### Filter Flow

1. User taps filter icon in CompactFilterBar
2. FilterPanel modal opens
3. User selects filters (brand, price, etc.)
4. FilterContext updates `filteredProducts`
5. `displayProducts` useMemo recomputes with new filtered results
6. FlatList re-renders

### Combined Search + Filter Flow

1. User applies filters → FilterContext updates
2. User searches → Search filters the filtered results
3. Result: Products matching BOTH search AND filters

## Usage Example

### For Customers

1. Navigate to a category (e.g., "Paints")
2. **Option A - Search**: Type "white" in search bar to find white paints
3. **Option B - Filter**: Tap filter icon, select "4+ stars" and "Under ₹500"
4. **Option C - Both**: Search "white" + Filter by "Asian Paints" brand + "4+ stars"

### Benefits

- **Faster Product Discovery**: Find exactly what you need in seconds
- **Better Decision Making**: Compare products with similar attributes
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No need to manually scan through hundreds of products
- **Improved Conversion**: Customers find what they want faster = more likely to purchase

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**:

   - `useMemo` for displayProducts (only recomputes when dependencies change)
   - `useCallback` for event handlers (stable references prevent re-renders)

2. **Virtualization**:

   - FlatList with windowing (only renders visible items)
   - `removeClippedSubviews={true}` for memory efficiency

3. **Debouncing**:

   - EnhancedSearchBar has built-in debounce (600ms default)
   - Prevents excessive re-renders while typing

4. **Grouped Products**:
   - Same products with different sizes shown as one card
   - Reduces render count significantly

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Search bar appears in CategoryScreen header
- [x] Search filters products within category only
- [x] Filter button opens FilterPanel
- [x] Filters work correctly (brand, price, rating, etc.)
- [x] Search + Filter combination works

- [x] Product count updates dynamically
- [x] Filter count badge shows correct number
- [x] Voice search works in category search
- [x] Performance is smooth with large product lists

## Future Enhancements

1. **Search Suggestions**: Show recent/popular searches in category
2. **Smart Filters**: Suggest relevant filters based on search query
3. **Save Filter Presets**: Allow users to save favorite filter combinations
4. **Sort Options**: Add sorting (price low-high, ratings, newest)
5. **Quick Filters**: Add category-specific quick filters in CompactFilterBar
6. **Search History**: Remember recent searches per category
7. **Filter Analytics**: Track which filters are most used

## Code Examples

### Using CategorySearchBar in other screens

```javascript
import CategorySearchBar from "../components/SearchComponents/CategorySearchBar";

function MyScreen() {
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");

  return (
    <CategorySearchBar
      value={searchQuery}
      onSearchChange={setSearchQuery}
      onClear={() => setSearchQuery("")}
      categoryName="Electronics"
    />
  );
}
```

### Adding FilterContext to any screen

```javascript
import { FilterContextProvider } from "../store/filter-context";

function MyProductScreen({ products }) {
  return (
    <FilterContextProvider products={products}>
      <MyProductScreenContent />
    </FilterContextProvider>
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Search not working

- **Check**: FilterContextProvider wraps the component
- **Check**: Products are properly flattened before passing to FilterContextProvider
- **Check**: searchProducts utility is imported and working

### Issue: Filters not applying

- **Check**: useFilter hook is called inside FilterContextProvider
- **Check**: filteredProducts is being used (not original products array)
- **Check**: FilterPanel is receiving correct props

### Issue: Header search bar not showing

- **Check**: navigation.setOptions is called in useLayoutEffect
- **Check**: CategorySearchBar is imported correctly
- **Check**: Header height is sufficient for search bar
