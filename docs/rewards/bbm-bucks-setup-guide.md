## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Firestore Indexes

**IMPORTANT**: You must create these indexes in Firebase Console before the system works properly:

#### Index 1: user_bbm_balance collection

- Collection ID: `user_bbm_balance`
- Fields: None required (single field queries only)

#### Index 2: bbm_bucks_transactions collection

- Collection ID: `bbm_bucks_transactions`
- Fields to index:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)

#### Index 3: bbm_bucks_transactions collection (complex queries)

- Collection ID: `bbm_bucks_transactions`
- Fields to index:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `type` (Ascending)
  - `status` (Ascending)
  - `expiryDate` (Ascending)

**How to create indexes:**

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Click on "Indexes" tab
5. Click "Create Index"
6. Add the fields as specified above

### 2. Initialize Collections

Run this command in your app console (browser dev tools):

```javascript
// After user login, initialize their BBM Bucks account
import { initializeBBMBucksForUser } from "./util/bbmBucksInit";

// Replace 'actual_user_id' with the logged-in user's Firebase Auth ID
await initializeBBMBucksForUser("actual_user_id");
```

### 3. Test the System

```javascript
// Test the BBM Bucks system
import { testBBMBucksSystem } from "./util/bbmBucksInit";

await testBBMBucksSystem("actual_user_id");
```

## Menu Integration

The BBM Bucks menu item has been added to the menu system:

### MenuScreen.js Updated:

- Added BBM Bucks menu item with ID 8
- Added navigation to BBMBucksUserDetails component
- Handles both authenticated and unauthenticated users

### Menu Item Structure:

```javascript
{
  id: 8,
  title: "BBM Bucks",
  icon: "ðŸ’°",
  description: "Reward points and cashback",
  route: "bbmBucks"
}
```
